Dataset:https://github.com/zhouhaoyi/ETDataset<br>
Using .py file in datapreprocess fold to deal with the missing value, abnormal value and make a comparision between original data and dealt data.<br>
The dealt data is saved in Dataset fold.<br>
In machine learning fold, using model_training.py to train model and find which model permfors best, and then using model_improve.py to add more features and make hyperparameter tuning.<br>
In Neural net work fold, using two diffient models:Bidrectory LSTM + LSTM, TPA+LSTM to train and test dataset.<br>
Part of models are saved in models fold.
